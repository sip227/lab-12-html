	<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
	
	<div id="intro">
		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply <strong>dummy</strong> text of the <b>printing and typesetting</b> industry. 
		Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
		when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
		It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
	
	<p>Contrary to <em>popular belief</em>, Lorem Ipsum is not simply <i>random text</i>. 
	It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
	Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
	consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
