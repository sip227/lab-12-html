For the homepage, it's the same as the cover of a book. If it is enticing then people
will want to explore the website. I think adhering to the basics would be a good start 
for a set up. The classic navigation menu and I think an automatic slide show would 
be good to show samples of some images of works like photos or drawings. Or to show
snippets of writing pieces like poetry or prose. I'd like for it to be consistent at
the very least. There needs to be more deliberation to help fill the content on this page.
Maybe add contact information at the bottom to make it less bare.
