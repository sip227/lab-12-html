For this page, depending on the topic can be seen as a portfolio or gallery page.
I would like to show the example of works I might have and be able to hover over 
to show the description of the work with the help of javascript. It might be hard to 
do the same with writing pieces unless there is image art and what pops out instead is the
actually writing so it is easier for the user to see examples of my work. I'm still thinking 
about examples about my work, either debating about uploading images of some projects or past poems.
